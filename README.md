# reads

In the application, the user can get recommendations for books they might enjoy. The recommendations are provided by [Readgeek](https://www.readgeek.com/). The service is very similar to the one Readgeek is providing, but the user can filter the recommendations by genre and check if the books can be found from the libraries in the capital area. The user can also create lists for the books.
